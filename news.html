<p><h2>More Information:</h2>
  <p><h3>Terminology on our Website:</h3>
    <p>We use several terms in our data about state laws that may not be entirely clear, or that may be seen as subjective. The following links and articles explain more about these terms and concepts.
    <p><h4>"Partial-Birth" Abortions:</h4>
      <p> "Partial-Birth" Abortion is not a medical term, but is nevertheless used by many legislators and pro-life groups. It generally refers to second and third-trimester abortion methods including the D&E and the D&X.
      <p> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2006/02/21/5168163/partial-birth-abortion-separating-fact-from-spin"> 'Partial-Birth Abortion': Separating Fact From Spin </a> - NPR
    <p><h4>Telemedicine:</h4>
      <p> Telemedicine is a broad term that refers to online appoinments and consultations with doctors, as well as medication that can be sent in the mail and self-administered.
      <p> <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-heartland/sayabortion/telemedicine-abortion"> What is Telemedicine Abortion? </a> - Planned Parenthood
    <p><h4>Viability:</h4>
      <p> Viability refers to a fetus' ability to survive outside the womb, and while there is no one definite point in a pregnancy where this happens, generally it is around 25 weeks. Some states ban abortions based on viability, while others have specific limits based on the gestational period in weeks.

  <p><h3>Abortion & the Transgender Community:</h3>
      <p> While many people think of abortion in relation to women, it is can also concern transgender men or genderqueer individuals, who can face many additional barriers on the path to seeking an abortion.
      <p> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2019/05/20/from-africa-to-alabama-men-seek-to-control-womens-bodies/#3fc615165274"> Abortion is an Issue for Transgender Bodies, Too </a> - Forbes, 5/20/2019

<p><h3>"Heartbeat" Bills:</h3>
<p> So-called "heartbeat" bills are not currently in effect, but pending or under review in several states. These bills would make abortion illegal after about 6 weeks, when the first heartbeat can be detected.
